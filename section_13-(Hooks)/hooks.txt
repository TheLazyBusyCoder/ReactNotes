/// HOOKS

  // starts with use 

  // React has 20 hooks 
    useState()
    useEffect()
    useReducer()
    useContext()
    useRef()
    useCallback()
    useMemo()
    useTransition()
    useDeferredValue()

  // Hooks can only be called at top level not in { if else , loops , nested functions}

  // Hooks can only be called from React Functions. { Component , custom hook }

  // Hooks rely on call order

  // Fiber tree node has a linked list which stores states data. 
  // It means states are conntected with each other with linked list. if the state is not in the top level , and is inside a if else , some times condition might be false , and one of the states would be not initilized , so in this situation linked list gets distoried.
