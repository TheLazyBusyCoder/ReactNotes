/// SETTING COMPONENT SIZE

	when component needs a lot of props , its to large 

	abstraction = to hide details 

	// when to seperate big component to small component 
	1. logical seperation of content/layout
	2. Reusability 
	3. Responsibilites / complexity 

	creating new components creats more abstraction (hiding of details)
	never declare new component inside of an component.

  // 3 types of natural component's 

  1. Stateless (presentational component)
  2. Statefull components 
  3. structural components
