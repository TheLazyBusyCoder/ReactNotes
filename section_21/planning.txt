/// THINK IN REACT

1. small scale
  // good for small application's 

  1. Break the desired UI into components 
  2. Build the static version ( no state yet )
  3. Think about state managment + data flow. 

2. large scale
  1. gather applications requirements 
  2. divide application into pages.   
    // for each page. 
    - think about the overall and page level UI.
    - Break the desired UI into components. 
    - Design and build static version 
  3. divide the application into feature categories
    - Think about state managment + data flow
  4. Decide on what libraries to use (technology decissions)

/// EXAMPLE:  (fast react pizza)

1. very simple application where user can order one or more pizzas from a menu
2. No user Accounts , no Auth (input the name before started using)
3. Pizza menu is loaded from the api so it changes. 
4. Users can add multiple pizzas to a CART beforing ordering. 
5. Ordering requires username , phone , address. 
6. if possible GPS can be used for additional help to the delivery
7. User's can mark their order as prority order , so 25% extra money on cart price.
